What is a so called “branch” in Git terms and why would you use it?

A branch is a pointer to one of the commits (snapshot of the content) that you've made. By default the branch is called Master, 
it moves automatically to the last commit. This allows you to view your commit history (and adjust previous versions of your content etc.)   
A new branch gives you a new pointer to move around with.
