Reasons for exclusion

To ensure the dataset is as complete as possible, multiple rows are excluded/
removed from the dataframe due to empty cells (NaN) or 'unknown' value.
When analysing the GDP data, it appeared that the GDP of Suriname was extremely
high compared to the GDP of other countries. This is likely a measurement or
data entry error.
The outliers in 'Infant Mortality' are not excluded, because these outliers are
likely to be 'true', e.g. higher Infant Mortality in third world countries,
such as Angola.
