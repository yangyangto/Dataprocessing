Q & A

1. Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
Both operators are used to compare for equality, but for the == operator the
data type must be identical to be considered equal. For the == operator data type
are not taken into account, meaning that if two values are not the same type
=== will simply return false, whereas == will return True.

another function (=closures) outer function's scope can be accessed from an
inner function.

A higher-order function is a function that either takes another function as an
argument or returns a function.
